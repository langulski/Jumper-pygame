   <p> This game is very similiar to the famous "fapply Bird", with some small changes of the game mechanics.</p>
  
  <p>Although not perfect, developing this game is a good way to learn Python with the best method that exists:
    CODING IT!!! </p>
   
<p> Quick note: there is a bug related to the total player Score, probably it is the font the I am using, will check later on. </p>
